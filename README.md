The idea of the project came when I couldn't find a site that supported both english and hungarian languages and didn't require e-mail registration just to do a simple task as a wish list. So I have decided to make this site and add it to my portfolio.

Skills I have learnt and improved during this project:

- The importance and the help of useCallback and useRef.
- Using the React Context API for deep nested states.
- Axios for backend API CRUD methods.
- Firebase querying
- Authentication using bcrypt, JWT
- Socket.io for real-time database updates, which enables frontend data update without the need of refreshing the page.
- Practicing the Router/Controller layout for express. (since I have used React the need of Views was not required)
- Practice how code review works on GitHub with the help of one of my friends
- How to prepare and deploy a fullstack app to Heroku.
